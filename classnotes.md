`React.createElement(tag name, attribute or props, children.)`
`createElement` lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing `JSX.`
const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)
Creating an element without JSX 
If you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative.
To create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type, props, and children:
import { createElement } from 'react';

-`Today, production ready React App - From scratch without using create react-app`
to Ignite our app we will use `Bundler` . `Bundler is package/module of javascript code` eg : vite,parcel,webpack

-we will be using Parcel here.but in the `create react-app, they use webpack bundler`
-bundlers are the way to organize and `combine many files of JavaScript code into one file`
-to have a package in code -> `we need Package Manager `(eg : npm, yarn)
`
`-npm init` (inorder to get npm in yourapp)-> create package.json ->initialise our repo with npm 
-npm init -y -> to skip configuration`

-npm manages all your packages.
why do u need packages?
React app is a huge app which doesnot run alone with react.There are different super power we need and these powers will come from these packages.these packages are from npm.->npm is a helper package.

Parcel :

npm install package-name -> to install a package named package-name  & node modules (helper functions )is created 

npm install -d parcel -> -D means dev dependency or --save-dev

dependency->all the packages that our project needs.
package-lock.json is created and parcel code is updated in node modules
parcel is in dev dependencies of package-lock - parcel is needed in dev environment
if update happens, package.json is updated but package-lock.json is not updated.
`package-lock.json` exactly tell u what  version of library u r using.
package-lock.json - never put it in gitignore .
if we have package-lock.json -> we can regenerate node modules
node modules is very heavy.no need to push to git




What's the difference between tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json?
The syntax of the npm version looks like the following.

Major.Minor.Patch->2.8.2 
caret:it will upgrade only minor versions
tilde(~):to upgrade major versions..o tilde and caret means u r stick to the current version.else auto updrade.
node module->like db for ur npm

react cdn - is not a good way. Good way is -> in server thrugh node modules
npm install react -> in `global dependencies` not dev dependencies

`npx parcel index.html` -> Execute using npm with index.html as entry point -> Creates local server
Parcel gives us this server.
Never edit your node_module or package-lock.json
Error : React is defined because we removed cdn link. Instead of that, we have to use import since this time we are using node modules - npm

Error : Browser doesnot understand import -> we have to inform its modules, use type="module" in script tag

Warning : React DOM -> createRoot is not found -> use react-dom/client

Live Server -> Auto refresh -> Hot Module Reloading (HMR) -> Parcel does it for us -> using File Watcher Algorithm (written in c++) Parcel.cache -> uses this space for doing all the HMR, minify and other stuffs dist folder -> minified code in dist npx parcel build index.html -> production ready build is created by parcel inside dist folder and has only 3 files : css, html and js file containing all the code including react code

`Parcel Functionalities :`

1.minification (removing indentation),
2.image optimizations,
3.compression(renaming variables),
4.cleaning our code,
5.super fast build,
6.dev and prod builds,
7.caching while development
8.works with older version of browsers
9.Https on dev as well npx parcel index.html --https 10.Consistent Hashing Algorithm 11.zero    config
10.Tree shaking - Removing unwanted code

we should put .parcel-cache in gitignore -> anything which can be autogenerated in server can be put in gitignore

Initial dev build -> longer time (500ms) -> for next build -> takes less time 5ms using caching

When using parcel, we give entry point in command so we can remove main: app.js from package.json

Transitive dependencies -> dependencies of dependencies Eg: Our App is dependent on Parcel which is again dependent on other dependencies (dependency Tree)

browsersList -> cross browser compatibility for older versions of browsers


Summary Steps :

npm init
npm install -D parcel
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npx parcel index.html or npx parcel build index.html
import React from 'react'; in App.js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; in App.js
use type="module" for index.html
Remove main : app.js from package.json
Write browserslist in package.json
"browsersList" : [ "last 2 versions"]
